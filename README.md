# CV Pipeline Template

> **Click "Use this template" to create your own CV pipeline!**

Automated CV generation pipeline that creates multiple psychologically-optimized CV variants from YAML data.

## Why This Approach?

**The AI Trap**: Most people use AI wrong for CVs

```mermaid
%%{init: {"theme": "dark", "themeVariables": {"darkMode": true, "background": "#2b2b2b", "mainBkg": "#3a3a3a", "secondBkg": "#4a4a4a"}}}%%
graph LR
    A[AI] -->|❌ Wrong| B[Complete CV]
    A -->|✓ Right| C[YAML Data]
    C --> D[Your Pipeline]
    D --> E[Professional CV]

    style B fill:#4a3a4a,stroke:#e599f7,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#3a4a3a,stroke:#94d82d,stroke-width:2px
```

**The Right Approach:**
- AI writes structured data (YAML facts)
- YOU control the pipeline and output
- Consistent quality across all variants
- Version controlled career narrative
- Update once → all CVs updated automatically

## Quick Start

### 1. Use This Template

Click the green "Use this template" button above to create your own repository.

### 2. Edit Your Data

Update the YAML files in `data/` with your information:

```bash
# Edit your personal info
vim data/personal.yaml

# Edit your work experience
vim data/experience.yaml

# Edit skills, education, certifications, strengths
vim data/skills.yaml data/education.yaml data/certifications.yaml data/strengths.yaml
```

### 3. Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add my CV data"
git push
```

### 4. Get Your CVs

GitHub Actions will automatically:
- Generate 3 CV variants
- Run tests to verify all data is included
- Create a release with PDF downloads

Download from: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/releases/latest`

## What You Get

**Three psychologically-optimized CV variants**:
- **Software Developer** - Creativity, problem-solving, technical expertise (Purple - innovation)
- **DevOps Engineer** - Collaboration, automation, developer enablement (Orange - energy & approachability)
- **Cloud Engineer** - Trust, scalability, expertise (Blue - professionalism)

Each variant filters your experience based on tags and uses color psychology to create the right first impression

## Data Structure

### personal.yaml
Basic contact information and taglines for each variant:

```yaml
first_name: "John"
last_name: "Doe"
email: "john.doe@example.com"
linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe"
github: "https://github.com/johndoe"
taglines:
  engineering-manager: "Engineering Manager"
  developer-advocate: "Developer Advocate"
  platform-engineer: "Senior Platform Engineer"
```

### experience.yaml
Work experience with tags for filtering:

```yaml
- title: "Senior Platform Engineer"
  company: "Tech Corp Inc"
  location: "Remote"
  start_date: "01/2022"
  end_date: "present"
  tags: ["technical", "platform", "leadership"]  # Used for filtering!
  achievements:
    - "Led development of microservices architecture"
    - "Improved deployment efficiency by 60%"
```

**Tag guide**:
- `development` - Appears in Software Developer CV
- `devops` - Appears in DevOps Engineer CV
- `cloud` - Appears in Cloud Engineer CV
- Mix tags to appear in multiple variants

### Other files
- `skills.yaml` - Programming languages, tools, cloud platforms
- `education.yaml` - Degrees and institutions
- `certifications.yaml` - Professional certifications with tags
- `strengths.yaml` - Key strengths with descriptions and tags

## Customization

### Add New Variants

1. Create template directory: `templates/new-variant/`
2. Add template file: `templates/new-variant/template.tex.j2`
3. Add tagline to `data/personal.yaml`
4. Tag relevant experience in `data/experience.yaml`
5. Update `Makefile` VARIANTS list
6. Update `.github/workflows/cv-build.yml` matrix

### Modify Colors/Design

Edit templates in `templates/*/template.tex.j2` - each uses AltaCV LaTeX class with customizable colors.

**Current color schemes** (based on color psychology research):
- **Software Developer**: Purple (#7C3AED) - Innovation, creativity, problem-solving
- **DevOps Engineer**: Orange (#FF6B35) - Energy, collaboration, developer enablement
- **Cloud Engineer**: Steel Blue (#4682B4) - Trust, reliability, professionalism

## Testing Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install PyYAML

# Build all CVs
make all

# Run tests
make test

# View PDFs
ls output/generated/*.pdf
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- TeX Live (pdflatex)
- poppler-utils (pdftotext, pdfinfo)

## How It Works

```mermaid
%%{init: {"theme": "dark", "themeVariables": {"darkMode": true, "background": "#2b2b2b", "mainBkg": "#3a3a3a", "secondBkg": "#4a4a4a"}}}%%
sequenceDiagram
    participant YAML as YAML Data
    participant Python as Python Generator
    participant LaTeX as LaTeX Compiler
    participant PDF as PDF Output
    participant Test as Test Suite

    YAML->>Python: Load data files
    Python->>Python: Validate & escape
    Python->>LaTeX: Generate .tex
    LaTeX->>PDF: Compile PDFs
    PDF->>Test: Validate completeness
    Test->>Test: All data present?
```

**Key Steps:**
1. Load YAML data from `data/` directory
2. Python validates and escapes special characters
3. Direct Python string building generates LaTeX (no templates)
4. LaTeX compiler creates professional PDFs
5. Test suite verifies 100% data completeness
6. GitHub Actions automates entire workflow

## Troubleshooting

### PDFs not generating locally?

Check dependencies:
```bash
# Python packages
pip list | grep PyYAML

# LaTeX
pdflatex --version

# PDF utilities
pdftotext -v
```

### Tests failing?

Run verbose test output:
```bash
python scripts/test_data_completeness.py
```

Common issues:
- Missing data in YAML files
- Special characters in LaTeX (use `\&` for `&`, `\%` for `%`)
- Tags not matching template filters

### GitHub Actions failing?

Check:
1. YAML syntax is valid
2. No special characters breaking LaTeX compilation
3. All required files present in repository

## Color Psychology Research

The color schemes for each CV variant are based on research in color psychology and professional perception:

**Research Sources:**
- [Resume Color Psychology - Standout CV](https://standout-cv.com/usa/resume-advice/resume-color-psychology) - How colors influence hiring manager perception
- [Color Psychology in Resume Design](https://www.stopthebleedday.org/2024/02/14/color-psychology-in-resume-design-using-color-to-influence-perception/) - Color impact on first impressions
- [Colors on Your Resume - Resume Giants](https://www.resumegiants.com/blog/colors-on-resume/) - Professional color choices and their meanings

**Key Findings:**
- **Purple (#7C3AED)**: Associated with creativity, innovation, and problem-solving - ideal for Software Developers
- **Orange (#FF6B35)**: Conveys energy, warmth, and collaboration - perfect for DevOps Engineers focused on developer experience
- **Blue (#4682B4)**: Represents trust, reliability, and professionalism - suited for Cloud Engineers

## FAQ

**Q: Can I add more CV variants?**
A: Yes! Create a new template directory, add Jinja2 template, and update the Makefile.

**Q: Do I need to configure secrets or tokens?**
A: No! The template works out-of-the-box with no configuration needed.

**Q: Can I customize the LaTeX templates?**
A: Absolutely! Edit the `.tex.j2` files in `templates/*/` directories.

**Q: How do I change which experience appears in each variant?**
A: Use the `tags` field in `experience.yaml`. Each template filters based on specific tags.
